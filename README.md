# Employee Attrition Analysis

## Project Overview
This project, undertaken as part of the Microsoft Power BI course at the Information Technology Institute (ITI), delves into the intricacies of employee attrition within a hypothetical company. Through a series of interactive dashboards, the analysis provides a comprehensive look at various factors influencing attrition rates, including demographics, job roles, salary levels, and more.

## Key Features
- **Multiple Dashboards:** Each dashboard focuses on a different aspect of attrition, offering detailed visualizations and insights.
- **Comprehensive Summary Page:** An overview of the entire dataset and key performance indicators (KPIs) related to employee attrition.
- **Actionable Insights:** Beyond identifying trends, the project provides recommendations to mitigate attrition rates effectively.

## Technologies Used
- **Microsoft Power BI:** Utilized for data modeling, analysis, and interactive dashboard creation.


## Findings & Recommendations
- The attrition rate is higher for young employees and fresh graduates.<br>
**Recommendations**
  - We must investigate deeper to find the cause for this problem and some suggestions maybe to:
    - Increase salaries for young talented employees.
    - Offer some training programs to help fresh graduates learn and advance in their career.

- The Attrition Rate for Employees who Travel Frequently is 50% higher than average.<br>
**Recommendations**
  - We need to provide transportation for employees who face long commutes.
  - We may offer transportation-money for those employees.

- We have a clear problem in the Human Resources Department.<br>
**Recommendations**
  - We must investigate more deeply to find the cause of this problem in this specific department.
  - We have a similar problem for Research specialists across different departments which needs deeper investigation

- Attrition Rate is lower than average by 30% for highly trained employees.<br>
**Recommendations**
  - We need to provide more training programs for our employees.

- **Attrition Rates are 100% higher than average for low-salary employees!**<br>
**Recommendations**
  - We need to provide special salary packages for talented employees or employees who have high potential.

-  Attrition Rate tends to go higher as the average overtime increases for an employee.<br>
**Recommendations**
   -  We need to make sure employees are well-appreciated for overtime hours.
   -  We need to make sure that overtime hours are optional.

-  As expected, employees who gave negative feedback in the employees/managersâ€™ survey have obviously higher attrition rate.<br>
**Recommendations**
   -  We must listen more to our employees and make sure to improve the work environment regarding to the surveys conducted.

-  Employees who have been working for us for many years have lower attrition rates than recently hired ones.<br>
**Recommendations**
   -  That assures that we have a problem with fresh or new employees as stated before.
